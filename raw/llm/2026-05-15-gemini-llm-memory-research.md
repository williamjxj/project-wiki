question: How can LLMs manage memory using public API chat, local Ollama, Karpathy LLM-wiki, and Agent Skills categorization?
status: ingested

## Q How LLM manage its memory? please help me research this solution:

1. a general app chat with LLM via public API, such as Anthropic, chatgpt, or miniMax.
2. app ask a question, and the LLM APIs return an answer.
3. next-time app ask a new question, the LLM API take the previous questions/answers as input, to retrieve LLM and return a synthetic answer

in my macbook pro there is a private LLM service: Ollama + local LLM.
I chat with above public LLM, so I have Q1 and A1
based on Kapathy's LLM-wiki and Agent-skills ideas, I re-assembled like this: put Q1 and Q2 as raw data, send to local Ollama env to generate a wiki summary: S1
the generated wiki S1 is saved as memory; and organized similar like Agent Skills: categoried as different topics/groups
next time when chat another question, for API payload, the input will be not mixed original Q1 and A1 , it is S1, so: Q2 + S1 = A2
then next time, Q3 + S2(similar like Skill triggered) = A3
and so on...
this way use 2 LLMs work together to manage memory to generate more intelligent and consistent answers can you based on my thought, to generate a more readable summary and analyse is this reasonable and feasible? if so, how to do it

## Gemini 1

Your idea is highly aligned with the current "LLM as an Operating System" trend popularized by Andrej Karpathy. By treating your local Ollama instance as a **Background Compiler** that transforms messy "runtime" chat logs into a clean, structured "Knowledge Base" (Wiki), you are essentially building a custom memory management unit for your AI.

### Summary of Your "Hierarchical Memory Synthesis"
Your proposed architecture moves away from **Linear Memory** (sending everything) to **Synthesized Memory** (sending only the essence).

| Stage | Action | Component |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Interaction** | User chats with high-reasoning Public LLM (Q1 → A1). | Public API (Claude/GPT) |
| **2. Synthesis** | Local LLM extracts "core facts" or "new skills" from Q1+A1. | Local Ollama |
| **3. Organization** | Summary S1 is categorized into a "Wiki" (e.g., `#coding`, `#business`). | Local Storage (Markdown/JSON) |
| **4. Retrieval** | Next prompt (Q2) triggers a search of the Wiki for S1. | Retrieval Logic |
| **5. Execution** | Public API receives `S1 + Q2` to generate `A2`. | Public API |

### Analysis: Is this Reasonable and Feasible?

**Reasonableness: High**
* **Token Efficiency:** Public APIs charge per token. Instead of sending 10,000 tokens of "How was your day?" filler, you send 200 tokens of "The user is building a bidding engine."
* **Context Quality:** LLMs often suffer from "lost in the middle" phenomena where they forget details in long histories. A distilled "Wiki" entry is much more potent.
* **Privacy:** You can use Ollama to filter or scrub sensitive PII (Personally Identifiable Information) before it ever hits the public cloud.

**Feasibility: Medium-High**
* The logic is straightforward, but the "categorization" and "triggering" (Step 4) are the hard parts. You need a way to ensure that when you ask about "Tax fees," the system pulls the `#finance` wiki entry and not the `#coding` one.

### How to Implement It (Technical Workflow)

Since you’re already working with **Python (FastAPI)** and **Ollama**, you can build this as a middleware layer.



#### 1. The Synthesis Prompt (Local Ollama)
Don't just ask Ollama to "summarize." Ask it to "compile into a skill."
> **Prompt for Ollama:**
> "Review the following Q&A. Extract any new facts about the user, project constraints, or technical decisions. Format as a Markdown 'Skill' entry with a category tag. If no new info is found, return 'NULL'."

#### 2. The Storage Structure (The "Wiki")
Organize your memory as a simple folder of Markdown files or a JSON object. This is more editable and "human-readable" than a complex vector database.
```text
/memory
  /coding_skills.md  (e.g., "User prefers FastAPI + Shadcn")
  /project_alpha.md  (e.g., "AgenticOmni uses vector search")
  /business_rules.md (e.g., "Fee declaration for 2025 is due")
```

#### 3. The Retrieval Logic (The "Skill Trigger")
Before calling the Public API, perform a quick "keyword" or "semantic" scan of your Wiki.
* **Simple:** Scan the user's new question (Q2) for keywords present in your Wiki file names.
* **Advanced:** Use a small embedding model locally to find which Wiki file is most relevant to the current question.

#### 4. The Augmented Payload
Construct the final prompt for the Public API like this:
```python
system_prompt = f"You are a helpful assistant. Use this known context: {retrieved_wiki_summary}"
user_message = current_question
# Send to Anthropic/OpenAI
```

### Potential Roadblocks to Watch
* **Synthesis Lag:** Running Ollama every time you get an answer might make the UI feel slow. **Solution:** Run the synthesis in a background task (async) *after* the user receives the answer, so the "Wiki" is ready for the *next* turn.
* **Over-Compression:** If Ollama summarizes *too* much, you might lose the "vibe" or specific phrasing the user liked. **Solution:** Keep a "Short-Term Buffer" (last 3 raw messages) alongside the "Long-Term Wiki."

This approach effectively turns your local machine into a "Brain" that manages the "Tongue" (the Public API). 

**What specific "Agent Skill" are you planning to have the system learn first—technical coding patterns or business logic?**


## Gemini 2


This is a sophisticated "Local Router" architecture. By using Ollama as the "Gatekeeper," you ensure that the high-reasoning (and expensive) public LLMs only see the most distilled, relevant data.

To help design the logic for this **Agent-Skill-Memory-Mechanism**, I need to understand how you want to handle the "handoff" between the local and public layers:

1.  **Keyword Definition:** How will the keywords be assigned to the memory chunks? Will you have Ollama auto-generate a list of keywords when it saves a new "Skill," or will you use a predefined "Taxonomy" (a fixed list of categories like `#backend`, `#frontend`, `#business`)?
2.  **The "Routing" Output:** When the Chat-App sends a question to Ollama, do you want Ollama to return the **full text** of the relevant memory, or just a **Skill-ID/Filename** that your backend then retrieves from your local storage?
3.  **Storage Architecture:** Are you leaning towards a **File-based Wiki** (individual Markdown files for each skill) or a **Structured Database** (JSON/SQLite)? (File-based is often easier for "Agent Skill" debugging, as you can read the files yourself).
4.  **Trigger Sensitivity:** If a user's question is vague and doesn't contain an exact keyword, should Ollama attempt to "guess" the category, or should it default to sending no extra context to the public API to save tokens?
5.  **Concurrency:** Since Ollama runs locally on your MacBook Pro, are you concerned about the "Time to First Token"? Meaning, would you prefer the local retrieval to happen in parallel with the chat, or must the public API wait for Ollama to finish its "Search" first?

**What is the first specific "Domain" of skills you want this system to manage?** (e.g., Technical Code snippets, Business Document rules, or general Personal Preferences?)

## Gemini 3

This approach essentially treats your local machine as a **Knowledge Compiler**. You aren't just storing chat logs; you are "compiling" them into a structured codebase of intelligence.

Based on Andrej Karpathy's "LLM-Wiki" and "Agent Skills" philosophy, here is the recommended architecture for your **AI-Knowledge Skill Engine**.

---

### 1. The Storage Structure: "Knowledge as Code"
Instead of a database, use a **Tiered Markdown Folder**. This makes your "memory" human-readable and version-controllable (via Git).

* **`/wiki/index.md`**: The "Map." A single file containing a list of all concepts, their keywords, and a 1-sentence summary.
* **`/wiki/concepts/`**: Deep dives into specific AI topics (e.g., `rag-patterns.md`, `agentic-workflows.md`).
* **`/wiki/projects/`**: Context on what you are building (e.g., `agentic-omni.md`, `bidding-engine.md`).

---

### 2. The Implementation Workflow
Since you want this to be **parallel** and **keyword-triggered**, the flow works like this:

#### **Phase A: The Request (Instant)**
1.  **Trigger:** You ask a question $Q$ in your Chat-App.
2.  **Local Scan:** The App does a simple, fast keyword scan of your `/wiki/index.md` (no LLM needed here for speed).
3.  **Augment:** If "RAG" is found in $Q$ and your index has a `#RAG` tag, the App pulls the content of `concepts/rag-patterns.md`.
4.  **Public Call:** Send `Q + [Retrieved Wiki Content]` to the Public API (Claude/GPT).

#### **Phase B: The Background Synthesis (Parallel/Ollama)**
While you are reading the answer from the Public API, your App kicks off an **Ollama Worker**:
1.  **Value Gate:** Ollama reads the latest $(Q + A)$ and asks: *"Does this contain new technical facts, decisions, or patterns? If no, stop."*
2.  **Incremental Update:** If valuable, Ollama reads the *existing* relevant Markdown file (e.g., `rag-patterns.md`) and **merges** the new info.
    * *Karpathy Hint:* Don't just append. Tell Ollama to "Rewrite the file to include the new insight while maintaining the existing structure."
3.  **Index Refresh:** If a new concept is created, Ollama updates `index.md`.

### 3. Key Prompts for your Ollama "Compiler"

To make this feasible, you need two specific prompts for your local model (like `llama3` or `mistral` via Ollama):

#### **The "Value Gate" (The Ignorer)**
> "Act as a Knowledge Sieve. Review this chat exchange. Determine if it contains reusable technical insights or project-specific decisions. If it is just general chat or repetitive info, respond only with 'SKIP'. If it is valuable, respond with 'PROCESS' and list the 3 most important keywords."

#### **The "Incremental Compiler" (The Updater)**
> "You are an expert technical writer. Below is an existing Wiki page and a new chat insight. Rewrite the Wiki page to integrate the new insight. 
> 
> **Rules:** > 1. Preserve all existing technical definitions. 
> 2. Add the new info under the relevant section or create a 'Latest Findings' section. 
> 3. Ensure the tone is 'Skill-based' (e.g., 'To implement X, do Y')."

### 4. Why this is Reasonable & Feasible
* **Reasonable:** It solves the "Context Window Bloat." Instead of the LLM reading 20 previous messages, it reads one highly optimized "Technical Manual" that you are building in real-time.
* **Feasible:** Since you use **Python (FastAPI)**, you can handle Phase B as an `io.BackgroundTasks`. The user never waits for Ollama; the "Memory" just gets smarter 5 seconds after the chat ends.
