# Frontend & Admin Tool Integration for mem-weaver

## Existing Tools/Apps to Integrate

### 1. Obsidian (Wiki Browser/Editor)
- **Role:** Human-friendly Markdown vault browser and editor
- **Integration:** mem-weaver’s wiki is already Obsidian-compatible. Users can open the `wiki/` folder directly in Obsidian for browsing, editing, and linking.
- **Benefit:** No extra dev needed for basic wiki management; leverage Obsidian’s plugins for graph view, backlinks, and search.

### 2. Next.js (Chat Frontend)
- **Role:** Modern React-based frontend for chat and knowledge navigation
- **Integration:** mem-weaver’s plan already includes a Next.js chat app with WikiSidebar. You can use open-source chat UIs (e.g., [Vercel’s AI Chatbot UI](https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot) or [OpenAI’s ChatGPT UI clones](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/apps/chatgpt-clone)) as a starting point.
- **Benefit:** Rapidly build a user-friendly chat interface; add wiki context display and admin panels as needed.

### 3. Admin Tools
- **Obsidian Plugins:** For advanced wiki management (e.g., [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks)), use Obsidian’s plugin ecosystem.
- **Custom Next.js Admin Panel:** For ingest stats, user/session management, and pipeline monitoring, extend the Next.js frontend with admin routes/components.
- **Open-source Dashboards:** Integrate with tools like [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) or [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for analytics if you expose stats via API.

### 4. Authentication/Authorization
- **NextAuth.js:** For user/session management in Next.js
- **FastAPI Users:** For backend user management if multi-user support is needed

## How to Integrate
- **Wiki:** Open `wiki/` in Obsidian for instant human-friendly admin.
- **Frontend:** Scaffold Next.js app, use open-source chat UI, add API calls to mem-weaver backend.
- **Admin:** Add admin routes/components to Next.js, or use Obsidian plugins for wiki management.
- **Monitoring:** Expose stats via FastAPI endpoints, connect to Metabase/Grafana for dashboards.

## Updated Recommendations (add to summary)
- Integrate Obsidian for wiki admin/browsing (already compatible)
- Use open-source Next.js chat UIs for rapid frontend development
- Extend Next.js with admin panels for stats, user/session management
- Leverage Obsidian plugins for advanced wiki/graph features
- Optionally, connect FastAPI stats to Metabase/Grafana for analytics
