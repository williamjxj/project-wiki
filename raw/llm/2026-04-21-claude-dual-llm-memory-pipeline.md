question: Is a dual-LLM architecture (Ollama wiki compiler + public LLM reasoner) reasonable and how should it be built?

Your idea is genuinely clever and architecturally sound. Let me clarify, refine, and analyze it before showing how to build it.

## Refined summary of your architecture

What you're proposing is a **dual-LLM memory pipeline**:

- The local Ollama model acts as a private "memory manager" — it never sees the internet, costs nothing per call, and converts raw Q&A exchanges into structured wiki-style knowledge
- The public cloud LLM (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) acts as the "reasoning engine" — but instead of receiving noisy raw history, it receives clean, categorized, distilled knowledge as context
- Each new question triggers a skill-like retrieval: the most relevant wiki summary for that topic is injected into the prompt, not a dump of previous turns

This is essentially a **local RAG pipeline where the "documents" are LLM-generated summaries of your own conversations**, organized by topic. Here's the architecture:---

## Is it reasonable and feasible? Yes — with some nuances

**What makes it strong:**

The core insight is excellent: raw Q&A history is noisy. A wiki summary is dense, structured, and more useful as context than a list of turns. This is essentially what human experts do — they don't re-read every email, they maintain a mental model that gets updated. Your architecture externalizes that mental model into a file store.

The two-LLM split makes economic and privacy sense. Ollama runs locally, costs nothing per call, keeps your raw conversations private, and handles the repetitive summarization work. The cloud LLM only sees the clean, distilled output — not your raw thinking.

**What requires care:**

The biggest design question is the **summary trigger**: when and how does Ollama update the wiki? If you regenerate the entire topic summary after every single turn, it works but adds latency to every exchange. A better approach is to batch: accumulate 3–5 turns, then update the relevant summary asynchronously (in the background after the answer is returned).

The second challenge is **topic classification**: how does the App know which summary `Sk` to retrieve for question `Qn`? You have several options — keyword matching, embedding similarity, or just asking Ollama itself to classify the question into a topic first.

## Per-turn implementation

Here's how a single turn works in practice:

```javascript
// ── STEP 1: Classify the incoming question ─────────────────────────────
async function classifyTopic(question) {
  const res = await ollamaChat([{
    role: "user",
    content: `Classify this question into ONE topic category (coding/design/ML/general):
    Question: "${question}"
    Reply with only the category word.`
  }]);
  return res.message.content.trim().toLowerCase(); // e.g. "coding"
}

// ── STEP 2: Retrieve the relevant wiki summary ─────────────────────────
function retrieveSummary(topic) {
  // Simple file-based store — one markdown file per topic
  const path = `./memory/${topic}.md`;
  return fs.existsSync(path) ? fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf8') : "";
}

// ── STEP 3: Ask the public LLM with summary as context ────────────────
async function askPublicLLM(question, summary) {
  const messages = [];
  if (summary) {
    messages.push({
      role: "user",
      content: `Here is your structured knowledge context on this topic:\n\n${summary}`
    });
    messages.push({ role: "assistant", content: "Understood. I'll use this context." });
  }
  messages.push({ role: "user", content: question });

  const res = await anthropic.messages.create({
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens: 1024,
    messages
  });
  return res.content[0].text;
}

// ── STEP 4: Update wiki summary via Ollama (async, after answering) ────
async function updateWiki(topic, question, answer, existingSummary) {
  const res = await ollamaChat([{
    role: "user",
    content: `You are a wiki editor. Update the existing knowledge summary below by 
incorporating new information from this Q&A exchange. Keep it dense, structured, 
and written in third person as factual reference material.

EXISTING SUMMARY:
${existingSummary || "(none yet)"}

NEW Q&A:
Q: ${question}
A: ${answer}

Output only the updated summary markdown. No preamble.`
  }]);
  
  const updated = res.message.content;
  fs.writeFileSync(`./memory/${topic}.md`, updated);
  return updated;
}

// ── MAIN TURN ORCHESTRATOR ─────────────────────────────────────────────
async function chat(userQuestion) {
  // Classify and retrieve
  const topic = await classifyTopic(userQuestion);
  const existingSummary = retrieveSummary(topic);

  // Answer using public LLM + wiki context
  const answer = await askPublicLLM(userQuestion, existingSummary);

  // Update wiki in background (non-blocking)
  updateWiki(topic, userQuestion, answer, existingSummary)
    .then(() => console.log(`Wiki updated: ${topic}`));

  return answer;
}
```

## Key design recommendations

**Use a simple file store first.** One markdown file per topic in a `./memory/` folder is enough to start. You can migrate to SQLite or a vector store later if you need fuzzy retrieval across topics.

**Separate "read" latency from "write" latency.** The Ollama wiki update happens AFTER you return the answer to the user. This way turn latency = Public LLM only. The wiki update happens in the background.

**Start with 5–8 fixed topic buckets**, not dynamic categorization. Dynamic topic discovery (letting Ollama invent new categories) is more powerful but harder to debug. Start fixed: `coding`, `system-design`, `ML`, `writing`, `general`.

**Version your summaries.** Keep the previous version before overwriting (`memory/coding.v2.md → v3.md`). This lets you debug cases where Ollama summarized something incorrectly and corrupted the context.

This architecture is genuinely novel as a personal tool — it's closer to how a well-organized person keeps notes than how most chatbots manage context. Would you like help building the full working prototype?
